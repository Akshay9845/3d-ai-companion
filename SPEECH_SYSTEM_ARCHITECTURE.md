## **🏗️ System Architecture Overview**

### **1. Input Processing Layer**
- **Voice Input**: Captured via microphone with enhanced speech recognition
- **Text Input**: Direct text input through chat interface
- **Hybrid Processing**: Real-time voice-to-voice conversation support

### **2. Speech-to-Text (STT) Layer**
```
Primary: Browser Web Speech API (Real-time, low latency)
Secondary: Whisper STT (High accuracy, multilingual)
```

### **3. AI Processing Layer**
```
LLM Integration: Groq/OpenAI for response generation
Context Management: Conversation history and personality
```

### **4. Text-to-Speech (TTS) Layer - MAIN SYSTEM**
```
🎯 PERFECT SPEECH PIPELINE (Primary System):
├── ElevenLabs TTS (Premium quality, streaming)
├── Intelligent text chunking for performance
├── Multi-layer audio playback system
└── Browser TTS fallback (reliability)

🔄 HYBRID AUDIO PIPELINE (Advanced System):
├── Whisper STT (99+ languages)
├── Bark TTS (Emotion-aware synthesis)
├── ElevenLabs polish (Optional enhancement)
└── End-to-end voice processing
```

### **5. Audio Playback Layer**
```
Tier 1: Web Audio API (Best performance)
Tier 2: HTML Audio Element (Compatibility)
Tier 3: Browser Speech Synthesis (Universal fallback)
```
