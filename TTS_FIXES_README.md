# TTS (Text-to-Speech) Fixes and Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Google TTS API Billing Error (403)
**Problem**: Google TTS API returning 403 error due to billing not being enabled on the Google Cloud project.

**Solution**: 
- Added fallback TTS using Web Speech API when Google TTS fails
- Added user notification system to inform about the billing issue
- Provided helpful modal with step-by-step instructions

### 2. Duplicate Chunk Processing
**Problem**: The same text chunks were being processed multiple times, causing redundant TTS requests.

**Solution**:
- Added deduplication logic using chunk hashing
- Improved streaming logic to track processed chunks
- Prevented duplicate TTS requests for the same content

### 3. Better Error Handling
**Problem**: TTS errors were not handled gracefully, causing the system to fail silently.

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive error handling for TTS failures
- Implemented fallback mechanisms
- Added user-friendly error notifications

## How to Fix Google TTS API Billing Issue

### Option 1: Enable Billing (Recommended)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Billing Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
2. Select your project: **#924492423009**
3. Click "Link a billing account"
4. Follow the setup process
5. Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate

### Option 2: Use Free TTS Services
The app now includes fallback TTS using the browser's built-in speech synthesis. While the quality is basic, it's functional and free.

### Option 3: Switch to Alternative TTS Services
Consider implementing:
- **Coqui TTS** (free, open-source)
- **Bark by Suno** (free tier available)
- **Local TTS engines** (eSpeak, Festival)

## Features Added

### 1. Fallback TTS System
- Automatically switches to Web Speech API when Google TTS fails
- Maintains functionality even without Google TTS
- Configurable voice properties based on emotion

### 2. User Notification System
- Shows helpful notification when TTS issues occur
- Clickable notification that opens help modal
- Auto-dismisses after 10 seconds
- Provides step-by-step instructions

### 3. Improved Streaming Logic
- Better chunk deduplication
- More efficient text processing
- Reduced API calls and errors

## Technical Details

### Fallback TTS Implementation
```typescript
private async fallbackTTS(text: string, emotion: string = 'neutral'): Promise<void> {
  // Uses Web Speech API as fallback
  // Configures voice properties based on emotion
  // Handles errors gracefully
}
```

### Deduplication Logic
```typescript
const chunkHash = text.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, ' ');
if (this.spokenChunks.has(chunkHash)) {
  console.log('üîÅ Skipping duplicate chunk');
  return;
}
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
if (error instanceof Error && error.message.includes('billing')) {
  // Use fallback TTS
  await this.fallbackTTS(cleanedText, emotion);
  // Show user notification
  setTtsNotification('Google TTS API requires billing. Using fallback TTS.');
}
```

## Testing

1. **Test with billing enabled**: Should use Google TTS normally
2. **Test with billing disabled**: Should automatically use fallback TTS
3. **Test notification system**: Should show helpful notification
4. **Test deduplication**: Should not process same chunks multiple times

## Future Improvements

1. **Multiple TTS Providers**: Add support for Coqui TTS, Bark, etc.
2. **Voice Selection**: Allow users to choose preferred TTS service
3. **Quality Settings**: Add quality vs. speed trade-offs
4. **Offline Support**: Implement local TTS engines
5. **Voice Cloning**: Add support for custom voice models

## Troubleshooting

### If fallback TTS doesn't work:
1. Check browser compatibility (Chrome recommended)
2. Ensure microphone permissions are granted
3. Try refreshing the page

### If notifications don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
3. Try clearing browser cache

### If Google TTS still fails after enabling billing:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for changes to propagate
2. Check API quotas and limits
3. Verify API key permissions
4. Consider regenerating API key

## API Key Security

Remember to:
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API usage and costs
